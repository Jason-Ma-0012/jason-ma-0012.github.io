# Q and A

## Known issues

-  **Please *copy* rather than change MooaToon resources whenever possible, otherwise conflicts may arise due to updates**
-  Known official BUGs in UE 5.1:
   - Sometimes the Ray Tracing Shadow of the character disappears, shows it again after running the game or hide / show the character
   - The ShadingModelID obtained Ray Tracing Shadow is always DefaultLit, which means that effects such as Subsurface Transmission do not work
   - The floor of the material preview window is black when Ray Tracing Skylight is enabled
   - OIT (Order Independent Transparency) causes translucent Blending Mode Add to become invalid
   - **Adjusting the Material Layer is quite easy to crash, remember to save it often when using it**
   - **The parameter descriptions of the Material Layer often disappears, please view the complete parameter description on the Parameters Panel after opening the material editor**

The following Console Variables are related to MooaToon.

## r.Mooa.XXX

These are custom console variables introduced by MooaToon to control uncommon or globally applied behaviors.

## r.Water.SingleLayer.ForceVelocity

The default value in stock Unreal Engine is `1`.

When Water is present in the scene, enabling this causes the Base Pass to output Velocity. Together with MooaToon's additional GBuffer targets, this can push the number of simultaneously bound Render Targets above the engine limit (8) and lead to a crash.

To avoid this, MooaToon sets the default value to `0`.

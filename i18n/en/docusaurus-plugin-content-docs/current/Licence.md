### Commercial Activity

**Before you obtain a Commercial License, you may not use MooaToon for any _Commercial Activities_**.

:::tip

Commercial Activities here refer to _**earning money directly from works rendered by MooaToon**_. For example:  

- Sales of game works using MooaToon 
- Using MooaToon for rendering, and embedded sponsor advertisements, or videos produced by sponsors  
    
- Using MooaToon for rendering, live streaming with monetary rewards 

_**Excluding indirect monetary gains, or indirect use of MooaToon**_, for example:  

- Publish works on websites such as YouTube without sponsorship, and receive platform revenue sharing based on views  
    
- Create works without sponsorship, and then earn fan subscription revenue through platforms such as Patreon  
    
- Using MooaToon to render images or videos, but not directly benefiting from it, and not constituting a primary component of a commercial work  
    

Specifically, _**if your work's purpose is to promote MooaToon, you do not need to obtain a commercial license!**_ For example:  

- Selling tutorials on how to use MooaToon

For some situations involving **multiple parties**, which party needs to purchase a commercial license is determined by **the copyright of the work**, for example:  

- A company pays an individual to make a video, and the video is published on the individual's account.  
    In this case the work's copyright belongs to the individual, and the individual needs to purchase the commercial license.
- A company pays an individual to make a video (or the individual is an employee of the company), and the video is published on the company's account.  
    In this case the copyright of the work belongs to the company, and the company needs to purchase a commercial license.
- For special situations such as copyright transfer or multiple parties sharing copyright,  
    the party with the largest income and scale needs to purchase a commercial license.

:::

Additionally, you can use MooaToon for any purposes other than commercial, but **you are solely responsible for all consequences of your actions**.

### Modification

**You are free to modify MooaToon as you wish, but all rights to MooaToon still belong to the author**.  

At the same time, it is also prohibited to change engine modifications or plugin content in an attempt to circumvent this agreement without significantly altering rendering techniques.
